# WKPageView
This is a Page Viewer built for use with WKWebView, to enable software like eBook readers to be developed more easily.

There are many page viewers written for use with WebView, the older and now deprecated API, but none that I could find which use WKWebView.  Sadly, WKWebView is significantly lacking in features compared with it's older counterpart - which makes the implementation of this functionality tricky.

## So what is it?
This is the beginnings of functionality which will enable an HTML document (for example, from an ePub file) to be loaded and paged through like a book.  Currently this functionality works - but there are many useful features (like bookmarking) which are still missing.

## TODO
Swiping on a page is still janky.  Best use the buttons for the time being until this is fixed.
